# This script should typically be run from "npm publish".

# Bower installs directly from GitHub using version tags. That means our
# generated files (e.g. compiled TypeScript) needs to be committed somewhere
# for each release. However, we don't want to litter our master branch with
# build artifacts. So we instead use a separate "release" branch.
#
# We also want each commit on the "release" branch to have two parents: 1) the
# previous release, and 2) the "master" branch commit that this release was
# built from. This way our Git history encodes both the chain of releases, and
# the master branch commit corresponding to each release.
